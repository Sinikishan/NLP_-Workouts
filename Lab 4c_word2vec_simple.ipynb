The Economic Vision 2030 focuses on shaping the\n","vision of the government, society, and the economy, based around three guiding principles;\n","sustainability, fairness, and competitiveness. Following the launch of the Economic Vision 2030,\n","the Economic Development Board (EDB)   initiated an on-going programme of economic and institutional\n","reform. The EDB led and coordinated with ministries to compile the first National Economic Strategy,\n","which served as a roadmap to achieve the Vision. The vision 2030 also addresses the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 (SDGs).\n","The guiding principles of the Economic Vision 2030 are sustainability, competitiveness, and fairness.\n","Sustainability\n","A considerable share of the country’s growth over the last two decades was driven by the public sector.\n","This model is running out of steam, as government finances become tighter and competition increases\n","in a global economy. By 2030, the private sector should be able to drive economic growth in Bahrain independently.\n","Bahrain's Vision sees the economic prosperity built on a firm foundation. Government finances will adhere to the\n","principle of sustainability, upholding a system that is stable and forward-looking. Bahrain will use its resources\n","to invest in the future, improving its human capital through education and training, particularly in the field of\n","applied sciences. In a world where modern technology and new competitors from across the globe are continually\n","shortening product lifetimes, entrepreneurship, and innovation will ensure the sustainability of a vibrant\n","private sector. But economic growth must never come at the expense of the environment and the long-term\n","well-being of Bahrainis. No effort will be spared to protect Bahrain's environment and preserve the kingdom's cultural heritage.\n","Competitiveness.Bahrain will attain a high level of competitiveness in a global economy.\n","Increased productivity comes about much more naturally in a competitive environment,\n","driving economic growth, profitability, and wages. Only high and continuously improving productivity\n","will enable businesses to increase their employees' wages. Higher productivity requires people with the\n","right skills for each position. To be Competitive; Bahrain will go to great lengths to educate their people,\n","\n","retain qualified staff, and attract foreign workers with the skills that are lacking.\n","The key is to make Bahrain a great place to do business for both local and foreign companies.\n","Many factors combined to make a country attractive to investors in high-value-added industries:\n","a high-quality public service, a cutting-edge infrastructure, and an appealing living environment are among.\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"metadata":{"id":"AxQW2C3JuEWv","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1698521290515,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":440,"user":{"displayName":"Sini
